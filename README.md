# WeatherInsight
A simple web-based application that displays real-time weather information for any city using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap) and shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The app features a responsive design and allows users to search by city name.
